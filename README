sspm is non-dependency support yet, since we must start somewhere.



The exit issue :
    making the script to exit at any error means that you cannot run a make test
    in the build process because some errors are 'normal' if we can say that
    (for example if certain dependencies are not available yet)
    
    in a graphical terminal you just need to be carefull,
    you can scroll up to check if the process did not encounter an error
    
    the program does not really exit if there is an error
    
    
    
sspm is a local package manager does not fetch anything from internet
means you must have downloaded all the necessary source files in a directory
and point "SRC" to that directory
